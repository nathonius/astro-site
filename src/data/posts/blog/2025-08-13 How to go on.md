Everything seems like it's falling apart. So many of the people I love are under attack, and the country I live in is losing itself to cruelty and authoritarianism. Money stresses, life stresses, it's all adding up to be overwhelming. It feels useless, but my only response is to go on living, helping where I can, speaking up for the people I love.

I have people depending on me, but the world doesn't depend on me. My country doesn't depend on me; I can't shoulder all of that burden. I will do what I can, speak up, and keep going on.
