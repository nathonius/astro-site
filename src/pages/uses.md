# All the things that I use

## Editor + terminal

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my primary editor.
- It changes from time to time, but I'm currently using the [Meslo](https://www.programmingfonts.org/#meslo) font, patched by [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads).
- On macOS and Linux, my terminal emulator of choice is [WezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html). I really like that WezTerm is configured by a json or lua file I can keep in source control. You can see my config in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/nathonius/dotfiles/blob/main/.wezterm.lua).
- I stick with [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) on PC (at least until WezTerm gets a bit more stable there).
- My shell of choice is zsh and I use [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) as a plugin manager. You can see my full zsh setup in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/nathonius/dotfiles/blob/main/.zshrc).
- I use [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/) to build my prompt; if you're still using Powerlevel10k, I recommend checking it out!
- I wrote my own terminal / editor theme, [Alloy](https://github.com/nathonius/alloy-theme), but have slowly been switching to [Catppuccin Frappe](https://catppuccin.com/) in most places.

## Desktop apps

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is my absolute favorite tool for taking notes and keeping track of things. I use it every day, and [maintain a number of plugins](./projects.md) for it.
- [Espanso](https://espanso.org/) is an essential part of my workflow.
- [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) is a better launcher for macOS, while I use [Ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io/) on Linux and [PowerToys Run](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/run) on Windows.
- [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) helps me keep my windows sane on macOS.
- [Charmstone](https://charmstone.app/) is a great alternative to alt-tab for frequently used applications on macOS.

## Platform

- All of my websites are hosted with [Cloudflare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), except for a few stragglers still on Netlify. I love being able to manage my domains, their DNS records, and deployments all from the same tool.
- For work (and more complex personal projects) I use [Angular](https://angular.dev/); I know it doesn't have the same level of popularity as React, but I find its developer experience unmatched.
- This site is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).

## OS

- If at all possible, I use Linux for development. My desktop Linux distribution of choice is [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/). I've been using it off and on starting in 2013 and it's been my favorite reliable distro since.
- I've been gaming on Windows since I could walk, and that probably won't change soon, but Linux gaming is getting better every day. Maybe one day I'll be able to ditch Windows entirely. For now, I use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) to make my life a little easier.
- I was a long time Mac hater, but after using a M2 Macbook Pro for work... I don't mind it. I treat it basically like Linux and still get frustrated by some of its peculiarities and bonkers UX decisions, but it's a solid machine with great battery life, and I can't really ask for more in a workhorse laptop. Still not going to buy an iPhone.
